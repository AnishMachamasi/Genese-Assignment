Question: Cryptocurrency Exchange API Integration and Trading Platform Development
Your objective is to build a web-based trading platform for cryptocurrencies that integrates with a
cryptocurrency exchange API. The platform should provide real-time market data, enable users to place
buy/sell orders, and track their portfolio. Your tasks include:
- Choose a reputable cryptocurrency exchange API and familiarize yourself with its
documentation, authentication mechanisms, and available trading endpoints.
- Develop backend functionality to fetch real-time market data, handle user authentication, process
buy/sell orders, and retrieve portfolio information.
- Design and implement a responsive frontend interface that displays market data, allows users to
place orders, and shows their portfolio performance. Implement real-time updates for price
changes and order status.
- Consider security measures such as implementing two-factor authentication, protecting sensitive
user information, and handling API rate limits.
